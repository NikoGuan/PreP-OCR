blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely
    wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which
    would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last,
   after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their
horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their
agony. Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had
been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such
dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think
   of. The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages
seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his
   ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.
In a paroxysm of fear, the boy (oliver twist) closed the book, and thrust it
    from him. Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such
deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for
crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought,
in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers;
and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never
known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate
and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.
  He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his
hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.
'What's that!' he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing
by the door. 'Who's there?'
'Me. Only me,' replied a tremulous voice.
Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. It was Nancy.
  'Put down the light,' said the girl, turning away her head. 'It hurts my eyes.'
   Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. The
girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply.
'God forgive me!' she cried after a while, 'I never thought of this.'
'Has anything happened?' asked Oliver. 'Can I help you? I will if I can. I will, indeed.'
    She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling
sound, gasped for breath.
    'Nancy!' cried Oliver, 'What is it?'
The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and,
suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold.
    Oliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a
little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.
'I don't know what comes over me sometimes,' said she, affecting to busy
herself in arranging her dress; 'it's this damp dirty room, I think. Now,
  Nolly, dear, are you ready?'
'Am I to go with you?' asked Oliver.
'Yes. I have come from Bill,' replied the girl. 'You are to go with me.'
'What for?' asked Oliver, recoiling.
