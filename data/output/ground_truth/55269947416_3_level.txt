the artist is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another
question.  He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty.  --Can you
solve that question now? he asked.  --  Aquinas, answered Stephen, says PULCRA

to lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.  The
dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin.  --When may we expect
