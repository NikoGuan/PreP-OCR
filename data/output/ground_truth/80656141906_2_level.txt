"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
seized me?"
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
  your health too sound for frenzy."
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
must be more of her."
  The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
  shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
   bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
  "Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
"My dear master (Rochester)," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
come back to you."
  "In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
    "You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
