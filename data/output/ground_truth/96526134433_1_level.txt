could write such a letter as that to Mr. Burke-pray read it, sir; you who have
seen something of what Mr. Burke has done for the town of Colambre, and what he
   has made of the tenantry and the estate of Lord Clonbrony.'
   Lord Colambre read, and was convinced that his father had never written or read
the letter, but had signed it, trusting to Sir Terence O'Fay's having expressed
his sentiments properly.
SIR, As I have no further occasion for your services, you will take notice,
    that I hereby request you will forthwith hand over, on or before the 1st of
November next, your accounts, with the balance due of the HANGING-GALE (which,
I understand, is more than ought to be at this season) to Nicholas O'Garraghty,
  Esq., College Green, Dublin, who in future will act as agent, and shall get, by
post, immediately, a power of attorney for the same, entitling him to receive
and manage the Colambre as well as the Clonbrony estate, for, Sir, your
obedient humble servant, CLONBRONY.
   'GROSVENOR SQUARE.'
   Though misrepresentation, caprice, or interest, might have induced Lord
Clonbrony to desire to change his agent, yet Lord Colambre knew that his father
    never could have announced his wishes in such a style; and, as he returned the
letter to Mrs. Burke, he repeated, he was convinced that it was impossible that
any nobleman could have written such a letter; that it must have been written
by some inferior person; and that his lordship had signed it without reading it.
'My dear, I'm sorry you showed that letter to Mr. Evans,' said Mr. Burke; 'I
   don't like to expose Lord Clonbrony; he is a well-meaning gentleman, misled by
ignorant or designing people; at all events, it is not for us to expose him.'
