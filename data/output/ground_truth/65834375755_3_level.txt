every soul they come across. And talking of that, I wonder where old Duke's
sinful soul is to-night? Wouldn't you think, to listen to the storm, the devils
  were making merry over him? Maybe they'll not let him rest in his grave."
"Whatever he was," said the other hoarsely, "and God knows I never heard much
   good of him, let us talk no more about his faults. He is gone where I hope he
will be judged mercifully."
"He won't, sir, if there is justice in Heaven," replied Donelly with dogged conviction.
"This is the Dunfanaghy road, isn't it?" said the younger man. "O! I know now
where we are; my way lies in the other direction. I am much obliged. Won't you
get yourself a glass of something?" he added with a natural hesitation, for it

  "Not at all, sir. What! just for telling you your road? and I am sure it was a
real pleasure to have company on such a night. Well, if I must-thank you; I'll
drink to your good health, and good luck to you."
