some parties given by persons of consequence, to which she was not invited. She
   feared that she should be forgotten in the world, well knowing how soon the
world forgets those they do not see every day and everywhere. How miserable is
the fine lady's lot who cannot forget the world, and who is forgot by the world
  in a moment! How much more miserable still is the condition of a would-be fine
  lady, working her way up in the world with care and pains! By her, every the
  slightest failure of attention, from persons of rank and fashion, is marked and
felt with jealous anxiety, and with a sense of mortification the most acute-an
invitation omitted is a matter of the most serious consequence, not only as it
regards the present, but the future; for if she be not invited by Lady A, it
will lower her in the eyes of Lady B, and of all the ladies of the alphabet. It
   will form a precedent of the most dangerous and inevitable application. If she
   has nine invitations, and the tenth be wanting, the nine have no power to make
her happy. This was precisely Lady Clonbrony's case-there was to be a party at
Lady St. James's, for which Lady Clonbrony had no card.
'So ungrateful, so monstrous, of Lady St. James!-What! was the gala so soon
    forgotten, and all the marked attentions paid that night to Lady St.
    James!-attentions, you know, Pratt, which were looked upon with a jealous eye,
    and made me enemies enough, I am told, in another quarter! Of all people, I did
  not expect to be slighted by Lady St. James!'
